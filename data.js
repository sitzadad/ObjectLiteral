    name:"Mercury",
    description:"Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days. Seen from Earth, it appears to move around its orbit in about 116 days, which is much faster than any other planet. It has no known natural satellites. The planet is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.",

    name:"Venus",
    description:"Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It has no natural satellite. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6, bright enough to cast shadows. Because Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, it never appears to venture far from the Sun: its elongation reaches a maximum of 47.8°.",

    name:"Earth",
    description:"Earth, also called the world and, less frequently, Gaia, (or Terra in science fiction) is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets and the only astronomical object known to accommodate life. Earth's biodiversity has evolved over hundreds of millions of years, expanding continually except when interrupted by mass extinctions. Earth is currently home to 10–14 million species of life. Earth's human population is divided among about two hundred sovereign states which interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade and communication media.",

    name:"Mars",
    description:"Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the \"Red Planet\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.",

    name:"Jupiter",
    description:"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn. Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian, giant, or outer planets. The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter is on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.",

    description:"Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Named after the Roman god of agriculture, its astronomical symbol (♄) represents the god's sickle. Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Although only one-eighth the average density of Earth, with its larger volume Saturn is just over 95 times more massive.",
